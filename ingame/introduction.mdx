## For Players

When your favourite game integrates the BeamXR InGame SDK, you get:

- **Cinematic Camera Controls** – Switch between multiple in-game angles for smooth, professional-looking streams
- **Optimised Performance** – Native integration means less system load and better stream quality
- **No Mic Issues** – Audio is handled directly in-game, so it works flawlessly
- **Capture Key Moments** – Record, clip, and share without leaving the experience
- **Built-In Stream UI** – Access everything you need without relying on external apps

🙋‍♀️ Want your favourite game to support it? Tell the devs and point them to [docs.beamxr.io](https://docs.beamxr.io)
