## 🗣️ How to Suggest a Feature

1. Join the [BeamXR Discord](https://discord.gg/beamxr)  
2. Head to the `#feature-discussions` channel  
3. Browse existing ideas — use the **search bar** to avoid duplicates  
4. **Upvote**, **comment**, or **add your own suggestion**

## 📝 Guidelines

Here’s how to make your suggestions count:

- **Search Before You Suggest**: Your idea might already be listed
- **Be Clear and Concise**: Explain what it is and why it’s useful
- **Vote**: Use 👍 or 👎 to signal your support or concerns
- **Be Constructive**: Share feedback respectfully when commenting on others' ideas

The BeamXR team monitors the channel and uses this feedback to help shape our roadmap — so your voice really matters!

Let’s build something amazing together 🚀
