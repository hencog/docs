## 2. Going Live on TikTok

<Warning>
  **Important: Not every TikTok account has RTMP access.**

  - TikTok usually requires at least **1,000 followers** and that you are **18\+ years old**.
  - Having TikTok Live access **does not** always mean you’ll have a **stream key**.
</Warning>

### Check if your account has RTMP access

1. Go to [livecenter.tiktok.com](https://livecenter.tiktok.com).
2. On the left-hand menu:
   - If you see a **“Go Live”** button, your account has RTMP access.
   - If you don’t see it, your account doesn’t currently have RTMP keys.

### Start streaming with BeamXR Live

1. In a browser, go to [livecenter.tiktok.com](https://livecenter.tiktok.com).
2. Click **Go Live** in the left-hand menu.
3. Enter your **stream category** and **title**.
4. Copy the **RTMP Server URL** and **Stream Key**.
   - TikTok issues a **new key every session** – copy a fresh one before you go live.
5. In BeamXR Live on your headset, paste the Server URL and Stream Key.
6. Press **Go Live** to start streaming directly to TikTok.

<Info>
  Just a heads up:**BeamXR can’t unlock TikTok Live or Stream Key access**  — that’s something TikTok provides directly.

## 3. Going Live with Restream (including TikTok)

A possible workaround using ReStream can enable you to go live on TikTok directly from your headset.

1. Create a **free account** at [Restream.io](https://restream.io).
2. Connect your social plaforms in the Restream dashboard.
   - When connecting TikTok, approval can take up to **a day** and is not always guaranteed.
3. Create a new **RTMP stream** in Restream.
   - Set your **stream title** and details.
4. Copy the **RTMP Server URL** and **Stream Key** from Restream.
5. Paste these into BeamXR Live on your headset.
6. Press **Go Live** – Restream will relay your stream to all the connected platforms.

<Info>
  Heads up: Not all TikTok accounts will work with Restream. Since this is managed by Restream/TikTok, we’re unable to provide support with account setup.
