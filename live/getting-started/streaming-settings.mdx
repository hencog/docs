description: "Hereâ€™s how to customise your stream settings in BeamXR Live â€” from titles and quality to categories and platform choice."
---

## Game Category

You can choose a game category so your stream is properly attributed on Twitch or YouTube.

- We currently use **IGDB** to list VR game titles.
- If a game is missing, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/beamxr).

<Info>
  You can also **submit new games to IGDB** by following their guide: [How to contribute to IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/contribute)
</Info>

We're also working on adding **non-game categories** like _Just Chatting_ soon.

---

## Stream Title

- You can set your stream title to anything you like.
- Currently, we **automatically add "BeamXR Live"** to the title and include a watermark.
- A **Pro tier** will soon allow you to **remove branding** and unlock advanced customisation.

We're also working on **more YouTube-specific controls** like thumbnails and privacy settings.

## Stream Quality

<Info>
  If youâ€™re having performance issues, try switching to 720p.
</Info>

You can choose between:

- **720p (HD)** â€“ Recommended for **Quest 2** or more demanding games.
- **1080p (Full HD)** â€“ For higher-end headsets and stronger bandwidth.

<Warning>
  If youâ€™ve enabled **Seamless Multitasking** (in Experimental Features on your Quest), this may affect performance. Try disabling it if streaming becomes unstable.
</Warning>

---

## Platform Selection

Choose whether to stream to **Twitch** or **YouTube**.

More platforms and **custom RTMP support** are on the way â€” stay tuned\!

---

## Saving Your Defaults

To save your go-to streaming settings:

1. Tap the **cog icon** in the BeamXR Live navigation menu
2. Adjust your preferences
3. Theyâ€™ll be saved for future streams automatically
