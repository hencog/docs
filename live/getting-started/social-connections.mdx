## Connect Twitch

You can connect your Twitch account during setup or any time later from the **Settings** menu.

1. In the BeamXR Live app, go to **Settings** and tap **Connect** next to Twitch.
2. This will open the **browser on your Quest**.
3. **Log into your Twitch account** and approve access for BeamXR.
4. Youâ€™ll be redirected to a confirmation page â€” once it says the connection is complete, you're good to go.
5. Return to BeamXR Live â€” Twitch will now show as **connected**, and you can close the browser.

## Connect YouTube

The process is the same for YouTube:

1. In **Settings**, tap **Connect** next to YouTube.
2. The Quest browser will open.
3. **Log into your YouTube (Google) account** and approve access.
4. Youâ€™ll be redirected to a success page.
5. Back in BeamXR Live, youâ€™ll see YouTube is now connected.
