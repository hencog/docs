Once you're live, you can view your stream chat directly in the BeamXR Live app.

If you enable **Seamless Multitasking** in your Quest **Experimental Features**, you can keep the BeamXR Live window open while in-game - perfect for monitoring your live chat.

Most players drag the window **above or below the main action** so it stays out of the way.

<Warning>
  This is a **Meta experimental feature**, so there may be quirks. Use at your own risk.
</Warning>
