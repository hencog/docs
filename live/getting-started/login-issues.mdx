## Logging in with Email & Password

If you created your account using an email and password, you’ll need to verify your email before logging in.

### Email Verification

When you sign up, we’ll send you a 4-digit code via email to confirm your account.

- Make sure to **check your spam or promotions folders**.
- If the email doesn’t arrive within a few minutes, try resending or double-checking your email address.
- Still no luck? Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/beamxr) and we’ll help you out.

## Logging in with Socials

You can also log in using **Google**, **Twitch**, or **Discord**.

### Google Logins & 2FA

If you're using Google, make sure you're completing **two-factor authentication (2FA)** if it's enabled on your account.

- You may be asked to **approve the login on your phone** or confirm via the **YouTube app**.
- For help with Google 2FA, check this [Google support guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en).
