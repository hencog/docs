title: "I Can’t See My Game on Stream"
description: "If your game isn't appearing on stream after going live, here are a few things to check:"
---
## 1. Share Your Entire View

When you hit **Go Live**, a system dialogue will appear asking what you want to share.

👉 Make sure you select **"Entire View"**, not just a single app.

Selecting only the BeamXR Live window or another 2D app, won't allow you to capture the immersive app you want to stream.

## 2. Test Meta Avatar Streaming

Use the **“Go Live with Meta Avatar”** feature as a test.

- If your stream works using this method, it confirms that your social connections (Twitch/YouTube) are functioning properly.
- That means the issue is likely with screen capture, not account setup.

---

## 3. Check Your Social Account Status

Streaming permissions may be blocked due to account restrictions:

### Twitch
- Make sure your account is **in good standing**.
- If you’re banned or restricted, streaming will fail silently.

### YouTube
- You must have a **verified YouTube account** to stream.
