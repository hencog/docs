<Danger>
  YouTube rate limits are causing login/YouTube-stream issues for some users. Weâ€™re working with Google on a fix.
</Danger>

_Last updated: 10 Aug 2025 (BST)._

**Whatâ€™s happening**
YouTube is rate-limiting our API usage. If your BeamXR account is linked to YouTube, you may be unable to log in or start a YouTube stream.

### Whoâ€™s affected

- Users who have **YouTube connected** in BeamXR Live.
- Twitch-only users are **not affected**.

### Why this is happening

We use YouTubeâ€™s APIs to create and manage streams on your behalf. We had more sign-ups than expected (ðŸŽ‰), which temporarily pushed us over our initial quota.

### Our fix

Weâ€™re working with Google to **increase our API limits**. Once approved, the issue will resolve automaticallyâ€”no app update required.

### Workaround (recommended)

If you want to stream right now:

1. Open **BeamXR Live â†’ Settings **
2. Under **Connections**, go to  **YouTube **hit the the 3 dots to open the call out menu and hit**Disconnect** 
3. Stream to **Twitch** (or reconnect YouTube after weâ€™ve lifted the limits)

<Info>
  You can reconnect YouTube later from the same menu.

### Status updates

Weâ€™ll update this page as soon as the quota increase is live.

If you still canâ€™t log in or stream after disconnecting YouTube, please reach out on **Discord** or see our other [**help articles**](/).
