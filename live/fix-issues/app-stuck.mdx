# Stuck on "Checking Social Connections" or "Waiting for Media"

## Clear BeamXR Live App Data

1. Open **Quest Settings**
2. Go to **General → Storage → Apps**
3. Scroll to **BeamXR Live**
4. Select **Clear App Data**

<Info>
  This logs you out and resets local settings. You’ll need to log in again.
</Info>

## Check Microphone Permissions

BeamXR Live needs microphone access to initialize streams.

1. Update Permissions:
   - Go to **Library → BeamXR Live (⋯) → App Permissions**
   - Ensure **Microphone** is set to **Allowed**
2. Relaunch BeamXR Live

<Info>
  If you denied microphone access on first launch, uninstall and reinstall the app to be prompted again.
</Info>

# Error: "Your session couldn’t be started"

If you see this error, it usually means BeamXR’s access to your social account has been revoked (for example, after a password reset or 2FA change).

## Fix — Refresh your social connections

1. In BeamXR Live, open **Settings → Connections**
2. Remove your existing connected platforms
3. Reconnect each platform and approve all requested permissions
4. Retry starting your stream or recording

<Info>
  If reconnecting doesn’t work, go to the social platform’s own security/settings page, revoke BeamXR access there, then try removing and reconnecting from the headset.
</Info>
