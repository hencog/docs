## You Must Verify Your YouTube Account

To live stream on YouTube, your account must be verified.

### How to verify:

1. Go to the [YouTube Verification Page](https://www.youtube.com/verify)
2. Choose your country and enter your phone number
3. Enter the 6-digit code sent via SMS or voice call
4. Wait up to **24 hours** for streaming to be enabled

## Check If Your Account Can Stream

You can check if your account is ready for streaming by visiting:\
👉 [youtube.com/features](https://www.youtube.com/features)

- Look under **Live Streaming**
- If it says **“Enabled”**, you're good to go
- If it says **“Eligible”**, it means you've started the process but it's not yet active
