## Mic Drops When You Open a Game

On Meta Quest, **microphone access is exclusive** â€” only one app can use it at a time.

- If **BeamXR Live is in focus**, the mic works for the stream.
- But when you launch or focus a game that requests the mic, the mic is handed over to the game â€” and your stream loses audio input.

We know this is frustrating â€” we want the fix as badly as you do\!

**Weâ€™re exploring multiple solutions to improve this:**

- **Mic Toggle Feature**\
  Weâ€™ve added a mic toggle for users with **Seamless Multitasking enabled**. You need to have this enabled, and BeamXR Live open for this to work. We have a guide on setting this up [here](https://help.beamxr.io/live/getting-started/how-to-install#7-seamless-multitasking-see-chat-in-game)

  You can now manually switch your mic to go **either to BeamXR Live or to the game** â€” but not both.

  <Warning>
    Some games will still **automatically take the mic back**, but BeamXR Live will now show an on-screen indicator so you always know if your mic is live on stream. **You must make sure **[**Seamless Multitasking**](https://help.beamxr.io/live/getting-started/how-to-install#7-seamless-multitasking-see-chat-in-game)** is enabled\!**
  </Warning>
- **OBS Workaround (Desktop Only)**\
  Weâ€™re working on support for users who want to stream via **desktop using OBS**. Â Youâ€™ll be able to:
  - Add your Quest headset as a **video and audio source** in OBS
  - Use a **separate microphone** on your PC for commentary or voice-over
  - Stream to Twitch, YouTube, or any custom RTMP destination
- **BeamXR InGame SDK**\
  When developers implement our SDK:
  - Mic issues are resolved completely
  - Stream performance improves
  - You unlock in-game camera angles and stream overlays
