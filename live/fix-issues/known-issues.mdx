## Mic Drops When You Open a Game

On Meta Quest, **microphone access is exclusive** — only one app can use it at a time.

- If **BeamXR Live is in focus**, the mic works for the stream.
- But when you launch or focus a game, the mic is handed over to the game — and your stream loses audio input.

We know this is frustrating — we want the fix as badly as you do\!

**We’re exploring multiple solutions to improve this:**

- **Mic Toggle Feature**\
  We're working with Meta to gain access to a system-level interface that would let you **toggle mic input between the game and BeamXR Live** — similar to how the Quest handles voice calls.
- - 🖥️ **OBS Workaround (Desktop Only)**  

    We’re working on support for users who want to stream via **desktop using OBS**.  

    You’ll be able to:
  - Add your Quest headset as a **video and audio source** in OBS
  - Use a **separate microphone** on your PC for commentary or voice-over
  - Stream to Twitch, YouTube, or any custom RTMP destination
- **BeamXR InGame SDK**\
  When developers implement our SDK:
  - Mic issues are resolved completely
  - Performance improves
  - You unlock in-game camera angles and stream overlays\
