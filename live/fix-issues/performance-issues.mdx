## **What do the stream health indicators mean?**

### **FPS (Headset Performance)**

We measure the frame rate of your stream before it’s uploaded.

- **Excellent** – Your headset is running smoothly and can handle the apps you have open.
- **OK** – Your stream is working, but performance could be better. Try the tips below to improve stability.
- **Poor** – Your headset is struggling. Close unused apps and try lowering your stream resolution (720p or below).

### **Network (Connection Quality)**

We automatically adjust your bitrate based on your internet connection.

- **Excellent** – Your connection is strong and your stream is uploading at high quality.
- **OK** – Your connection is stable, but not strong enough for 1080p. We’ll reduce your bitrate to keep things smooth — for best results, stream at 720p or lower.
- **Poor** – Your connection isn’t fast enough for a stable stream. Try lowering your resolution further or improving your Wi-Fi signal.

# Tips To Improve Performance

## 1. Close Other Apps

The Quest headset is optimised for running games first. When streaming, running additional apps such as browsers, Spotify, or calls can impact performance.

We recommend only having your game and BeamXR Live open at the same time.

---

## 2. Stream Quality Settings

If you’re still having performance issues, reduce your stream resolution.

On Quest 2 in particular, 720p or lower is more stable and uses fewer resources.

1080p streaming is currently experimental and may cause stuttering or dropped frames.

---

## 3. Seamless Multitasking

Seamless Multitasking is a Meta experimental feature that can increase CPU usage.

Try disabling it in your Quest **Settings \> Experimental** or hide the taskbar while streaming to reduce load.

---

## 4. Battery Level

When your headset battery is low, performance may be reduced to conserve power.

We recommend streaming with your headset plugged in or at least above 50% charge.

---

## 5. Network Quality

If your headset performance feels fine but your stream looks poor, your internet connection may be the cause.

Ensure you have a strong, stable Wi-Fi signal and sufficient upload speed for streaming.

Poor Wi-Fi signal or network congestion can cause dropped frames, buffering, or failed streams.

---

## Other Tips

- Close any unnecessary background apps before launching BeamXR Live.
- Restart your headset to free up memory if performance has degraded over time.
- Avoid streaming immediately after powering on — wait a minute to let the system settle.
