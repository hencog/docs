title: "Performance Issues"
description: "If your stream is stuttering, lagging, or failing to start, there are a few things that might be causing it. BeamXR Live performance depends on several factors:"
---

## 1080p Is Experimental

- **1080p streaming is currently experimental.**
- If you’re having issues, switch to **720p** — it’s more stable and uses fewer resources.

---

## Network Quality

- Streaming requires a **strong and stable internet connection**.
- Poor Wi-Fi signal or high network congestion can cause dropped frames, buffering, or stream failure.

---

## Game Performance

- Some games are **more performance-intensive** than others.
- Heavily detailed or unoptimised games may struggle to run smoothly with streaming active.

---

## Headset Hardware

- BeamXR Live performs best on newer headsets like the **Quest 3** or **3S**.
- **Quest 2** may struggle more, especially at higher stream resolutions or with intensive titles.

---

## Experimental Features

- Features like **Seamless Multitasking** can increase resource use.
- Try disabling them in your Quest **Settings \> Experimental** if you’re seeing poor performance.

---

## Battery Level

- A **low battery** can lead to thermal throttling or reduced performance.
- Try streaming while your headset is plugged in or above 50% charge.

---

## Other Tips

- **Close other background apps** before launching BeamXR Live
- Restart your headset to free up memory if performance has degraded over time
- Avoid streaming immediately after boot — give the system a minute to settle
