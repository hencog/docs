title: "Why BeamXR Live Requests Permissions"
description: "BeamXR Live needs a few system permissions to function properly. Here’s a breakdown of what we request and why:
"
---

### `android.permission.INTERNET`  
Used to stream your gameplay to Twitch, YouTube, or a private link, and to connect to your BeamXR account.

---

### `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`  
Lets us capture your microphone so your voice can be included in the stream.

---

### `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`  
Keeps BeamXR Live running in the background (e.g. while you’re in-game) without being shut down by the system.

---

### `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION`  
Allows BeamXR to capture your VR display — this is how your gameplay gets streamed.

---

### `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`  
Reserved for future features that allow **local video playback** inside the app.

---

### `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`  
Required to access your microphone while the app is running as a foreground service (like during a live stream), following newer Android/Quest policies.

---

### `android.permission.CAMERA`  
Used to support **Mixed Reality (MR) passthrough streaming** and **Meta Avatar face tracking** in supported headsets.

---

### `io.beamxr.beamxrlive.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION`  
An internal permission used for secure communication within the BeamXR Live app.  
It’s not accessible to any other app on your device.
