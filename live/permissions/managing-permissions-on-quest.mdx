BeamXR Live needs certain permissions to stream and record your gameplay — like access to your microphone, camera, and display.

If something isn’t working (e.g. no mic audio or black screen), it’s worth checking your app permissions.

## How to Check App Permissions

1. On your Quest headset, open **Settings**  
2. Go to **Apps > Permissions**
3. Find and select **BeamXR Live**
4. Review the following permissions:
   - **Microphone** – should be **enabled**
   - **Camera** – should be **enabled** (for passthrough / face tracking)
   - **Display Capture / Screen Recording** – should be **enabled**
   - **Network / Internet** – typically enabled by default

## Resetting Permissions

If something seems off or BeamXR Live isn't behaving properly:

1. Go to **Settings > Apps > BeamXR Live**
2. Choose **Clear App Permissions**
3. Relaunch the app — it will ask you to re-grant any required permissions

---

## Common Fixes

- If your **mic isn’t working**, check the Microphone permission is enabled
- If your **stream shows a black screen**, check Display Capture is enabled and you're sharing the **Entire View**
- If **face tracking or passthrough** isn't working, ensure Camera access is on
